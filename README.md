# CEO Diversity

It's common to hear anecdotes about how "all CEO's come from private boys schools". Well rather than use anecdotes it'd be great to use data. So lets try to answer:
- What's the ratio of private vs public schools execs?
- Men vs women in the top job/s?
- Is there any diversity or is it truly just "middle aged white guys"


## Goals:
1. Get ASX top N companies, where N could be 10, 100, 1000, etc
2. For each company get it's executive team
3. For each executive, get as many of the following as possible:
    - Age
    - Sex
    - Ethinicity
    - High school
    - University qualification and subject
